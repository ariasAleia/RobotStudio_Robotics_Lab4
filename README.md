# Lab 4: Industrial Robotics

This repository contains the modules in RAPID generated by RobotStudio. In these modules, you will find the code used to define different paths to draw the letters AEC with the robot ABB IRB140. For this reason, it was necessary to use a marker as the end effector and to design the marker holder.

## Path generation in Robotstudio

Ok! We already have the tool in RobotStudio. Let's begin to create the necessary things to draw our AEC. What do we need? We need to create a Workobject.

### Creating a workobject

In order to use the same path, which will allow the robot to draw our AEC, with a different plane orientation or position, we need to create a workobject. 

A workobject defines a different coordinate system. In our case, we will attach that workobject to a rectangular surface as shown in the image below.

As you can see, the workobject creates a different coordinate system. If we move the surface, everything that is defined in that workobject will move as well. That's exactly the behaviour that we are looking for. If it seems a little bit confusing, don't worry. We will see it later with more detail.

### Creating the targets

Workobject ready. Now what? We need to create the targets that will belong to the path. Ok... Targets... Sure. What's that? Targets are points with a determined position and orientation that will reach the robot with its TCP. In our case, those targets will be defined in the workobject that we just created. Those targets will have a position in x and y of the workobject's coordinate system. The image below shows all the targets that we need and their respective names.

Those names can be found in the variables declaration in the source code. Here you can see how all those targets belong to the workobject called _Tablero_.

The last target is called Up. This one is used to lift the marker in order to begin another trace. 

### Creating the paths

Ok! We are getting closer. We have our targets but now we have to
